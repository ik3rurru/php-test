# PHP Technical Test

To run this code, you need to have PHP installed on your system. If you're using Windows, make sure to add the path to your ``php.exe`` in the system's environment variables.

## Running from the Terminal

Open the project directory from the terminal and execute it with the following command:

```bash
php index.php
```

## Observations

I have spent about 3 hours on this task, spread over several days. I've aimed to write clean and easily readable code for other developers, and I've added some comments describing different parts of the code.

The core part of the code is within a single function called ``generate()``.

* CLAUSES: To format the template, I used PHP's ``str_replace()`` function , con la cual , This allows me to replace placeholders with their corresponding clauses based on the specified IDs.

* SECTIONS: To address this point, I performed a similar operation, but this time nesting a ``foreach``  loop to analyze the listed IDs. Once I have these IDs, I used another ``foreach`` rloop to go through the clauses and get the corresponding text. The final step is to verify which of these IDs match those in our list.

## Testing 

For test and debug the code, in my php.ini I have activated errors and warnings alerts. And to perform this test I just made sure that I don't have any of those alerts.


## Final conclusion

I believe I've managed to achieve the desired result in a relatively simple and efficient manner. However, there's always room for improvement. To iterate through all the data and traverse the dataset as requested, I've used several nested foreach loops for clauses and sections.

To improve the code my idea would be to separate each section into different functions. One to replace the clauses and one for the sections.

And I would explore how to work with ``array_map()`` function instead of concatenating the final text of the clauses with a simple array.
